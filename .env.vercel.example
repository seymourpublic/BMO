# Frontend Environment Variables (Vercel)

# Backend API URL (Railway)
# Get this from your Railway deployment URL
# Example: https://bmo-ai-assistant.up.railway.app
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-railway-backend.up.railway.app

# Note: VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose the variable to the browser
# This tells the frontend where to find the backend API
